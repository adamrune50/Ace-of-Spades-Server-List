# Ace-of-Spades-Server-List
Retrieving game data from a JSON and posting it on a webpage

### **Languages:**
HTML, PHP, CSS, Java Script and JSON.
### **Website:**
http://aos.acornserver.com

### **Description:**
A list of servers with relevant details retrieved from a JSON file, which allows people to connect to the user-hosted servers and play the game if they have the game installed. The style sheets for the website are also written by myself and there are scripts that allow users to search for servers and to join a server which may not be appearing on the list (such as for a local host connection).
